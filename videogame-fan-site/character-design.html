        Great game characters are remembered not only for how they look, but for how they move,
        speak, and grow as the player spends time with them.

          <h2 class="section-title">Silhouette &amp; visual identity</h2>
          <p>
            A strong silhouette helps players recognize a character instantly, even from far away.
            Shape language, color, and costume all work together to communicate personality and role.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bold shapes make characters readable in fast-paced scenes</li>
            <li>Color palettes hint at alignment, class, or faction</li>
            <li>Details like gear and accessories tell stories without words</li>

          <h2 class="section-title">Animation &amp; expression</h2>
          <p>
            Idle animations, combat moves, and facial expressions bring characters to life.
            Even small gestures can show nervousness, confidence, or humor.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Body language reinforces who a character is</li>
            <li>Facial animation and camera framing support key story beats</li>
            <li>Player control must still feel responsive and readable</li>
          </ul>

        <article class="card">
          <h2 class="section-title">Backstories &amp; relationships</h2>
          <p>
            Lore, dialogue, and player choices shape how we feel about characters. Companions,
            rivals, and NPCs can become fan favorites based on how they react during the story.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Backstories explain motivations and conflicts</li>
            <li>Relationship systems can create bonds over time</li>
            <li>Even small NPCs add depth to the world’s culture</li>
