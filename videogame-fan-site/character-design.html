      Memorable characters are more than just good art — they combine visual design,
      animation, voice acting, and player choice.

        <h2 class="section-title">Visual silhouettes &amp; readability</h2>
        <p>
          Good character design is readable at a glance. The silhouette, color palette, and
          key shapes tell the player who this character is and what they can do.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Distinct shapes help players recognize characters quickly</li>
          <li>Colors hint at roles: healers, tanks, villains, or mysterious figures</li>
          <li>Costume details connect to the game’s world and culture</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Backstory &amp; player connection</h2>
        <p>
          Behind every design, there is a backstory: where the character came from, what they want,
          and how they change. Even if the player never reads the full lore, good writing shapes
          the way a character feels on screen.

      <h2 class="section-title">Playable characters vs. NPCs</h2>
      <p>
        Player characters are designed for control and customization, while NPCs often serve
        to populate the world and push the story forward. Both are essential for immersion.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Playable characters often have more animations and equipment options</li>
        <li>NPCs add life to cities, villages, battlefields, and small side stories</li>
        <li>Companions can become fan favorites through banter and relationship systems</li>
      </ul>
