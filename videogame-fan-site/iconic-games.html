          <h2 class="section-title">Assassin’s Creed series</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> series is known for its historical settings,
            open-world stealth, and parkour-style movement. Each game drops the player into a
            different time period, blending fictional stories with real cities and events.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Explores eras like the Renaissance, ancient Egypt, and more</li>
            <li>Combines stealth, parkour, and close-quarters combat</li>
            <li>Uses a modern-day framing device to connect the entire timeline</li>

          <img src="images/0028.jpg" alt="Need for Speed racing screenshot" class="responsive">
          <p>
            The <strong>Need for Speed</strong> series focuses on fast cars, drifting, and
            cinematic street racing. It helped define arcade-style racing with licensed cars,
            neon-lit cities, and high-speed police chases.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Emphasis on speed, style, and vehicle customization</li>
            <li>Accessible handling, focused on fun rather than full realism</li>
            <li>Strong use of lighting and music to build “racing at night” atmosphere</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Many iconic games are remembered for their characters and narratives. Games like
            <strong>Wildermyth</strong> show how procedural storytelling can turn each campaign
            into a personal myth that feels unique to the player.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Characters age, gain traits, and carry scars from past adventures</li>
            <li>Comic-style story panels adapt to player choices and outcomes</li>
            <li>Tactical battles and narrative events are tightly linked</li>

          <h2 class="section-title">Golden Joystick Awards</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Golden Joystick Awards</strong> are one of the longest-running game
            award shows. A key feature is that many categories are decided by
            <strong>player votes</strong>, not just by a small panel of critics.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lets players directly support their favorite games of the year</li>
            <li>Includes categories for genres, community support, and overall GOTY</li>
            <li>Shows how fan opinion and critical acclaim can both shape a game’s legacy</li>

          <h2 class="section-title">Why awards matter</h2>
          <p>
            Awards and nominations help highlight standout games, but they also reflect what
            different audiences value. Player-voted awards like the Golden Joysticks may
            celebrate different titles than jury-only ceremonies.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spotlights smaller or indie games that connect strongly with players</li>
            <li>Helps developers see which design choices resonated most</li>
            <li>Becomes part of how future players discover “classics” to try</li>
          </ul>
