          <h2 class="section-title">Assassin’s Creed series</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> series is known for its historical settings,
            parkour-style movement, and open-world stealth gameplay. Each entry drops the player
            into a different time period, blending fictional stories with real events and cities.

            <li>Explores eras like the Renaissance, ancient Egypt, and more</li>
            <li>Combines stealth, combat, and traversal across rooftops and landmarks</li>
            <li>Uses “present day” framing to connect multiple games into one timeline</li>

          <h2 class="section-title">Need for Speed series</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Need for Speed</strong> series focuses on fast cars, drifting, and
            street racing energy. It helped define arcade-style racing games with flashy visuals,
            licensed cars, and high-speed police chases.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Emphasis on speed, style, and tuning vehicles</li>
            <li>Mix of realistic cars with accessible, arcade-style handling</li>
            <li>Soundtracks and city lighting that make races feel cinematic</li>

          <h2 class="section-title">Storytelling standouts</h2>
          <p>
            Many iconic games are remembered for how they tell stories, not just how they look.
            Games like <strong>Wildermyth</strong> show how procedural storytelling and
            character growth can make each playthrough feel like a personal myth.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Characters change over time, gaining scars, traits, and legendary status</li>
            <li>Events are combined like panels in a comic book, creating a unique tale</li>
            <li>Player choices and tactical decisions ripple into long-term narrative arcs</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Golden Joystick Awards</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Golden Joystick Awards</strong> are one of the longest-running game
          award shows. What makes them especially interesting is that many of the categories
          are decided by <strong>player votes</strong> rather than only by a small jury.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Highlights which games players themselves are most excited about</li>
          <li>Includes categories for genres, community support, and overall game of the year</li>
          <li>Shows how fan opinion and critical reception can both shape a game’s legacy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Awards like this help recognize not only big-budget blockbusters, but also smaller
          titles that connect strongly with their communities.
