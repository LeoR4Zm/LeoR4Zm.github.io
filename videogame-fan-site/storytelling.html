    <p class="page-subtitle">
      Games combine cutscenes, dialogue, player choice, and environmental clues to tell stories
      that feel personal and reactive.

        <p>
          Some games follow a fixed story path, while others allow multiple endings or routes.
          Both approaches can be powerful, depending on how they match the game’s goals.

        <ul>
          <li>Linear stories focus on pacing and cinematic moments</li>
          <li>Branching stories react to the player’s choices and actions</li>
          <li>Side quests and optional content add depth to the world</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Environmental storytelling</h2>
        <p>
          Not all story information is delivered through dialogue. Level design, props,
          lighting, and background details can quietly suggest history and mood.
        </p>
        <p>
          An abandoned room, a broken robot, or graffiti on a wall can say just as much
          as a spoken line of dialogue.
