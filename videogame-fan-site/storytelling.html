      <p class="page-subtitle">
        Games mix cutscenes, dialogue, player choice, and environmental clues to tell stories
        that respond to what the player does.

          <h2 class="section-title">Linear vs. branching stories</h2>
          <p>
            Some games follow a single, carefully directed narrative, while others branch into
            different paths and endings. Both approaches can be effective, depending on the
            experience they aim to create.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Linear stories emphasize pacing and cinematic moments</li>
            <li>Branching stories react to choices and encourage replays</li>
            <li>Side quests and optional content deepen worldbuilding</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="section-title">Environmental storytelling</h2>
          <p>
            The world itself can act as a storyteller. Level design, props, notes, and visual
            details quietly hint at what happened before the player arrived.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Abandoned rooms, graffiti, and ruins suggest past events</li>
            <li>Lighting and sound guide emotion without a single line of dialogue</li>
            <li>Small details reward players who like to explore slowly</li>

          <h2 class="section-title">Story-driven games &amp; <em>Wildermyth</em></h2>
          <p>
            Some games are built almost entirely around narrative choices and character arcs.
            <strong>Wildermyth</strong> is a great example: it blends tactical combat with
            comic-style story panels, letting characters age, change, and carry scars from
            one campaign to the next.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Procedural events create unique stories for each playthrough</li>
            <li>Characters can retire, form families, and return in later campaigns</li>
            <li>Player decisions shape both the plot and how heroes develop over time</li>
