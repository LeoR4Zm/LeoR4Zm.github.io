        <h2 class="section-title">Example: Sandbox &amp; Creative – Minecraft</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Minecraft</strong> is a classic example of a sandbox game: instead of following
          a fixed storyline, players explore, build, and experiment inside a blocky world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Survival mode asks players to gather resources and stay alive, while creative mode
          removes danger and lets players focus on construction and redstone machines.
