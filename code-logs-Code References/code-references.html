      <h2>What did I look up?</h2>
      <p>
        I looked up the CSS property <code>border-radius</code>, which is used to round the
        corners of boxes, buttons, images, and other elements. By changing its value, a
        developer can make corners slightly rounded, heavily curved, or even turn a square
        element into a circle.

    <!-- 3. Differences between the sites -->
    <section>
      <h2>How did the information differ between sites?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>MDN Web Docs</strong> presents <code>border-radius</code> in a very
        technical and complete way. It includes the full formal syntax, tables of
        possible values (including shorthand notation), and detailed notes about
        elliptical radii and browser compatibility. It feels like a professional
        reference manual rather than a tutorial, and it is especially useful when I
        need precise definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>W3Schools</strong> focuses on a shorter, beginner-friendly explanation.
        It shows a simple definition, a few clear examples, and a “Try it Yourself”
        editor that lets me experiment with the code directly in the browser. It does
        not go into as much depth as MDN, but it is very fast for checking basic usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CSS-Tricks</strong> is more practical and design-oriented. The page
        explains how <code>border-radius</code> behaves in real layouts, and it
        includes diagrams and examples that show the differences between using one
        value, two values, or four separate values. It also demonstrates patterns such
        as pill-shaped buttons, circular images, and asymmetric rounded corners, which
        makes it easier to imagine how I would use the property in an actual project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GeeksforGeeks</strong> provides a straightforward explanation with
        several small examples. The page walks through common use cases and includes
        code snippets with outputs. It is less visual than CSS-Tricks and less formal
        than MDN, but it is helpful if I want to see quick, step-by-step examples for
        different values of <code>border-radius</code>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Features a good code reference should offer -->
    <section>
      <h2>What features should a good code reference page offer?</h2>
      <p>
        After comparing these four resources, I think an effective code reference page
        should offer a mix of precise information and practical examples. In particular,
        it should include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A short, clear definition in plain language.</li>
        <li>A syntax section that shows how to write the property or tag.</li>
        <li>Several small code examples, ideally with a live preview or editor.</li>
        <li>Visual aids (such as diagrams or screenshots) for layout and shape changes.</li>
        <li>Browser compatibility information or a warning if support is limited.</li>
        <li>Notes about common mistakes, edge cases, and best practices.</li>
        <li>Organized headings or a mini table of contents so it is easy to scan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When a page combines these features, it serves both as a teaching resource for
        beginners and as a quick reference for more experienced developers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Which resources were good or bad -->
    <section>
      <h2>Which resources stood out as good or bad?</h2>
      <p>
        For learning and using <code>border-radius</code>, <strong>CSS-Tricks</strong>
        stood out as the most helpful overall because of its diagrams and practical
        layout examples. It made it easy to understand how different values change the
        shape of an element and how to apply those patterns in real designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>MDN Web Docs</strong> was the strongest strict reference. It is the
        best place to check the exact syntax, parameter meanings, and browser support,
        even though it is more technical and less beginner-friendly than the other
        sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>W3Schools</strong> and <strong>GeeksforGeeks</strong> were both easy
        to read and good for quick refreshers. Their examples are simple and direct,
        but they do not go as deep into advanced layouts or edge cases as CSS-Tricks
        and MDN. None of the sites felt “bad,” but each one is better suited for a
        different purpose: quick code examples, deep reference, visual guides, or
        step-by-step tutorials.
