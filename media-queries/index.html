      <h2>1) How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>CSS media query</strong> lets you apply styles only when certain conditions about the user’s device or environment are true. 
        The basic form is <code>@media (&lt;condition&gt;)</code> followed by a block of CSS rules. When the condition matches—such as a 
        viewport width under 700px, a dark color scheme, or a user who prefers reduced motion—the browser uses those rules. Media queries 
        are the foundation of <em>responsive design</em>: they help the same HTML adapt to phones, tablets, laptops, large monitors, and 
        accessibility preferences without duplicating pages.
      </p>
      <pre><code>@media (max-width: 700px) {
  .grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        In short, media queries let your layout, typography, spacing, and features feel “native” to each context—improving usability, 
        performance, and accessibility.
